            <h2> Weekly Lessons Breakdown </h2>

            <h3>Week 1: Introduction to Python</h3>
            <p>Students will begin their Python journey by exploring its history, features, and applications in various fields like web development, data science, and automation. They will set up their coding environment by installing Python and a code editor such as VS Code or PyCharm. The week will cover basic syntax, including variables, data types (int, float, string, boolean), and simple operations. Hands-on exercises will include writing and running Python scripts, printing output to the console, and performing basic mathematical operations.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 2: Control Structures</h3>
            <p>This week focuses on making decisions and controlling program flow using conditional statements. Students will learn how to use if, elif, and else to execute different blocks of code based on conditions. They will also explore logical operators and, or, not to create more complex decision-making processes. Additionally, students will be introduced to loops (for and while) to handle repetition efficiently. By the end of the week, they will complete exercises that involve creating simple decision-based programs, such as a basic chatbot or a number-guessing game.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 3: Functions</h3>
            <p>Students will discover the power of modular programming by learning to define and call functions. They will understand the importance of parameters and return values in making functions reusable and efficient. The lesson will also cover variable scope, distinguishing between local and global variables. Activities will include writing functions for mathematical calculations, text processing, and interactive user input handling. By the end of the week, students will develop small programs that rely on well-structured functions to solve specific problems.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 4: Data Structures</h3>
            <p>This week introduces essential Python data structures. Students will learn how to create and manipulate lists using methods like append, remove, sort, and slicing techniques. They will also explore tuples and understand their immutability. The lesson will conclude with an in-depth look at dictionaries, including how to create, update, and retrieve key-value pairs. Hands-on exercises will involve building data-driven applications, such as a contact manager or a simple inventory system.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 5: Advanced Topics</h3>
            <p>Students will deepen their understanding of Python with more advanced topics. They will explore string manipulation techniques, including formatting, splitting, and joining strings. List comprehensions will be introduced as a more efficient way to create and filter lists. Finally, students will learn the fundamentals of error handling using try-except blocks to prevent crashes and manage exceptions gracefully. By the end of the week, students will work on small coding challenges to reinforce these concepts.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 6: Final Project</h3>
            <p>In the final week, students will apply everything they've learned to develop a small real-world project. They will brainstorm ideas, plan their project structure, and implement features using functions, control structures, and data structures. Projects may include a personal expense tracker, a quiz application, or a text-based adventure game. Students will present their projects, participate in peer reviews, and receive constructive feedback. This final project will serve as a milestone to demonstrate their Python proficiency.
