            <h2> Weekly Lessons Breakdown </h2>

            <h3>Week 1: Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Students will be introduced to JavaScript, its history, and its role in web development. They will set up their development environment, including installing a code editor like VS Code and running JavaScript in the browser console. The lesson will cover basic syntax, variables, data types, and console.log() for debugging. Simple exercises will help studentsgrasp how JavaScript executes in a web browser.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 2: Variables and Data Types</h3>
            <p>This week focuses on declaring and using variables with let, const, and var. Students will explore JavaScript's primitive data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, and symbols. They will also learn about type coercion and type checking to understand how JavaScript handles different data types dynamically. Hands-on exercises will involve declaring variables, performing basic operations, and experimenting with type conversions.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 3: Operators and Expressions</h3>
            <p>Students will dive into JavaScript operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. They will learn how expressions are evaluated and the importance of operator precedence. Through interactive exercises, students will apply their knowledge by solving mathematical problems and creating simple logic-based conditions that rely on expressions.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 4: Control Structures</h3>
            <p>This lesson introduces decision-making and looping structures in JavaScript. Students will explore if, else if, else, and switch statements for controlling program flow. They will also learn about loops (for, while, do-while) to handle repetitive tasks. The week will conclude with a hands-on project: a number-guessing game that uses conditional logic and loops to interact with user input dynamically.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 5: Functions</h3>
            <p>Students will learn about functions as reusable blocks of code, covering function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions. They will explore function parameters, return values, and scope (local vs. global). The lesson will also touch on higher-order functions. Activities will involve writing small functions that perform tasks like calculations and string manipulations, reinforcing the importance of modular code design.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 6: Arrays</h3>
            <p>This week focuses on working with arrays, covering how to create, modify, and traverse arrays using built-in methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), map(), filter(), and reduce(). Students will practice managing collections of data efficiently and apply their knowledge by building a to-do list application that dynamically updates as tasks are added or removed.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 7: Objects</h3>
            <p>Students will be introduced to JavaScript objects and key-value pairs, learning how to create, access, and modify object properties. They will explore object methods and the this keyword, understanding how objects can represent real-world entities. The class will include hands-on exercises where students create objects representing books, users, or products, emphasizing the importance of object-oriented programming principles.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 8: The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
            <p>This week covers the structure and manipulation of the DOM, allowing students to interact with web page elements dynamically. They will learn how to select elements using getElementById and querySelector, modify content with innerHTML, and handle events like clicks and form submissions. By the end of the week, students will build an interactive web page that responds to user input, such as a simple calculator or a dynamic list.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 9: Final Project</h3>
            <p>Students will apply all the concepts they've learned to build a final projectâ€”a small interactive web application that incorporates variables, functions, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, and event handling. They will also learn best practices for writing clean and maintainable JavaScript code. The course will conclude with presentations, feedback, and guidance on further JavaScript learning opportunities.
